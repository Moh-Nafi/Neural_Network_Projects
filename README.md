Deep Learning is one of the most highly sought-after skills in artificial intelligence (AI).<br/>
Welcome to the Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and NLP Projects repository! This repository houses a collection of exciting projects that explore various aspects of Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) using Python.<br/>
### Overview
In this repository, you will find projects that cover a wide range of topics in the fields of Machine Learning, Neural Networks, and NLP. Each project aims to provide insights and practical experience in implementing state-of-the-art models and techniques to solve real-world problems.
<br/>
### Python Modules and Tools
The projects in this repository will primarily be developed using Python, and the following Python modules and tools will be frequently utilized:

1. NumPy: For numerical computing and handling arrays.
2. Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
3. Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization and plotting.
4. Scikit-learn: For building and evaluating Machine Learning models.
5. TensorFlow and Keras: For developing Neural Network models.
6. Gensim: A Python library that is primarily used for natural language processing (NLP) and topic modeling.<br/>

### Project Structure
Each project in this repository will have its own dedicated folder containing the necessary code, data, and documentation. The project folders will be organized in a logical and structured manner, making it easy for you to navigate and explore each project individually.<br/>
